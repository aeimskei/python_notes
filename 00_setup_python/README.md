# Installing Python 3

Go to http://www.python.org/ to install. Follow their instructions.

## Commands in the Terminal

The computer doesn't automatically understand the Python code because it's a high-level language. It has to be passed on to the Python Interpreter to understand. The Interpreter is basically a shell, you can run python code or the whole file.

* **python3 --version**  - checks version
* **python3** - to stay in terminal and get into shell mode to interpret python
* **control^z** - to get out of the python shell
* **pip3** - to install something globally
* **pip3 install pipenv** - to install the environment
* **pipenv shell** - will create a virtual environment in the terminal for project
* **python filename.py** - to run the python file

When you see `>>>` in the terminal, you're in the shell. You can practice Python here.
