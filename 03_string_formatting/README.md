# String Formatting

More options to output data to the console, where you don't have to break out from the string and you can format the data as well.

## Previous Version

string.py file
```
num1 = 3.14159265
num2 = 10.2552

print('num1 is', num1, 'num2 is', num2)
```

terminal
```
03_string_formatting :> python3 string.py
num1 is 3.14159265 num2 is 10.2552
```

## Format Method Version, `.format()`

It's similar to JavaScript's **template literals** of `${variable}`, but still pretty different, but same concept ðŸ˜…

But, in Python, when you put the variables `num1` and `num2` into the `.format()` method, think of them as indexes, the first argument is `0`, the second is `1`.

string.py file
```
num1 = 3.14159265
num2 = 10.2552

print('num1 is {0} and num2 is {1}'.format(num1, num2))
```

terminal
```
03_string_formatting :> python3 string.py
num1 is 3.14159265 and num2 is 10.2552
```

## Precision Formating

You can control what you see of the varaible's value. For instance, `num1 = 3.14159265` and you want only three digits to show like, `num1 = 3.14` to add format, you add `:` after the index number, a `.` point and number amount inside the `{}`.

Is something like, `{0:.3}` to show a total of three digits.

string.py file
```
num1 = 3.14159265
num2 = 10.2552

print('num1 is {0:.3} and num2 is {1:.3}'.format(num1, num2))
```

terminal
```
03_string_formatting :> python3 string.py
num1 is 3.14 and num2 is 10.3
```

## Formatting by Decimal Point

It's same to the **precision formatting**, but just add `f` on to the number of digits you want to show. The `f` kinda represents **floating number**.

string.py file
```
num1 = 3.14159265
num2 = 10.2552

print('num1 is {0:.3f} and num2 is {1:.3f}'.format(num1, num2))
```

terminal
```
03_string_formatting :> python3 string.py
num1 is 3.142 and num2 is 10.255
```

## Formatiting by F-String

You just put a little `f` before to say that you're going to format that string.

string.py file
```
num1 = 3.14159265
num2 = 10.2552

print(f'num1 is {num1} and num2 is {num2}')
```

terminal
```
03_string_formatting :> python3 string.py
num1 is 3.14159265 and num2 is 10.2552
```

You can also format it it still like the previous examples.

string.py file
```
num1 = 3.14159265
num2 = 10.2552

print(f'num1 is {num1:.4f} and num2 is {num2:.4f}')
```

terminal
```
03_string_formatting :> python3 string.py
num1 is 3.1416 and num2 is 10.2552
```
