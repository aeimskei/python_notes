# Why Python

It can be used for a ton of things and can be easily picked up as well. A high-level programming language.

* **Create websites** - with Django/Flask framework, also Instagram and Dropbox uses Python

* **Run scientific applications** - with libraries such as SciPy to do that, to perform scientific computations, NASA uses Python too

* **Control robots** - very cool! And can interact with the Raspberry Pi

# Python is Considered...

A general purpose programming language because it can be used for many different things. For example, PHP was created purely for the web. Python can be used for many things though.

A high-level programming language because this language abstracts away from low-level machine code so that it's more human-readable. For that reason though, we need a Python interpreter, to run the Python code through so that the computer can understand it.

# What to Learn

* **Types** - numbers, strings, lists, dictionaries
* Classes, objects, functions & control flow
* How to interact with files on your computer (read and write files)
* Will create mini-projects (Bar Tab Calculator, Random ispum Generator, Downloading & Saving Images)
